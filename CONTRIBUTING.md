# How to Contribute

As an open source project, DjangoMultiTenant welcomes contributions of all forms. If you would like to bring the project forward, please consider contributing in the following areas:

- **Maintenance:** We are actively looking for maintainers for DjangoMultiTenant. This includes (but is not limited to) triaging issues, reviewing pull requests and picking up stale ones, helping out other
  users on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nawtybean/DjangoMultiTenantPublic/discussions), creating minimal, complete and
  verifiable examples or test cases for existing bug reports, updating documentation, or fixing minor bugs that have
  recently been reported.

- **Code Contributions:** We are actively looking for Django/Python Coders to help develop our product roadmap and implement new features.
- **Documentation Contributions:** Any additions/modifications to documentation is highly welcome
- **Report a Bug:**
### The best way to report a bug is to file an issue on GitHub. Please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.


## General considerations

1. Please take a look at our code of conduct Link [HERE](https://github.com/nawtybean/DjangoMultiTenantPublic/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## Getting started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a branch for your changes

This last step is very important, don't start developing from master, it'll cause pain if you need to send another change later.

For more information on creating a Pull Request from a fork, follow this guide:

[Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Testing

We are looking for contributors to implement unit tests, aswell as using Tox to run tests/linting before a pull request is raised.

## Submitting a pull request

Once you're happy with your changes and they look ok locally, push and send send [a pull request][submit-a-pr] to the main repo. A maintainer should take a look at your change and give you feedback or merge it.
