## Installation and Configuration

Let‚Äôs get started - Local development !
====================

Before we get started, it is important to note that this app is a Multi-Tenant app using ID's to seperate the tenants. The app uses subdomains i.e. yourcompany.DjangoMultiTenant.co.za to identify different tenants.

1\. Fork the Repo and Create Virtual Environment
=============================================

*   Fork the repo.

cd to DjangoMultiTenantPublic

*   Build virtual environment for the project

````python
python manage.py -m venv venv
````

this will create a virtual environment, now we need to activate it

On Windows

````
.\venv\bin\activate
````

On Linux

````
source venv/bin/Activate
````

Remember to create a new branch on your repo! Do not use master/main as this will cause issues later on for subsequent pull requests!


2\. Installing Requirements
=====================

After complete forking the repo, creating a venv and activating it, install the requirements.txt

````python
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

3\. Set hosts for local development
===================================
For local development, it is recommended to setup a psuedo domain (as this is a multi tenant app). Open your hosts file and add an entry that looks something like this: (There are a lot or resources online to add entries to your host file for your respective OS ). You can use any domain name you like.

````
127.0.0.1		acme.DjangoMultiTenant.co.za
````

4\. Database
================================

As this is this a cookie cutter project, we are using

![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/sqlite-%2307405e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)


5\. Set the Environment Variables
================================

Create a .env file in the root directory of DjangoMultiTenant, and set the following Variables

````python

# Dev
SECRET_KEY=< Your Secret Key Goes Here>

# Environment
DEVELOPMENT=True/False
````


6\. Starting your DjangoMultiTenant app
================================

The first step is to run migrations

````python
python manage.py migrate
````

Once migrations are successfull, there is a custom command under:


````
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ root
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ system_management
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ managment
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commands
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ makesuperuser.py
````
You can double check and change the super user details in here.

Run this command using:

````
python manage.py makesuperuser
````

Then we start the app using the domain you specified

````
python manage.py runserver acme.djangomultitenant.co.za:8000
````

7\. Let‚Äôs get started - Deployment  !
